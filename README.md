This repository demonstrates a potential integer overflow bug in assembly code.  The `bug.asm` file contains code that adds two values, potentially resulting in an overflow if the sum is greater than the maximum value representable by the register. The `bugSolution.asm` file provides a solution to prevent this overflow by checking the values before the addition and handling the overflow accordingly.
